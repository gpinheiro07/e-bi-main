# Project Introduction
## Development of a Comprehensive Back-End Environment of an E-Commerce Platform
This project focuses on building a robust and scalable back-end architecture for an e-commerce application. It aims to provide essential functionalities such as user management, product catalog, order processing, and payment integration. Throughout this journey, I will explore various architectural patterns and technologies to ensure best practices are followed.

As I navigate the development process, I am committed to documenting my architectural decisions and the rationale behind my technology choices. This project serves as an opportunity for me to deepen my understanding of back-end development, microservices architecture, and cloud deployment while creating a practical and functional e-commerce solution.
